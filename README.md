## About Me and the Blog!
I'm Shweata, an undergrad from Mysore. I'm an aspiring Science Communicator and an science education enthusiast with a love for open science and music. I'm also learning code.

I'm setting up the blog for two main reasons:
- to encapsulate all my work in one place
- to propel me to learn new things and **document** my experience and setting up this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is going to be one of them!

I've spent days trying to find a free Jekyll theme that suits my purpose. After some frustration and going down the rabbit hole of themes, I finally found [Feeling Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive)! It's well-documented, aesthetically pleasing and has also got responsive video embedding. How cool is that!
